DESCRIPTION

This dataset contains the structure, collected data and descriptive statistics of responses to 3 surveys on code smells detection and visualization aimed at validating the conclusions of [1]. These surveys were administered stepwise:

    -pre-test for identifying unclear questions and collecting suggestions for improvement; the 27 respondents were Portuguese researchers in the area of Software Engineering;
    -improved survey (based on pre-test improvement suggestions) sent to the 193 authors of the primary papers on code smells detection;
    -further improved/customized survey sent to authors of published work on software visualization in at least one of its two major conferences (VisSoft and/or SoftVis), taken from the SLR of Merino et al. [2], complemented by answers obtained through an announcement on this survey publicized in the SoftVis blog (https://softvis.wordpress.com/).
